# Flixel-Portable Engine
Flixel-Portable Engine is a HaxeFlixel Engine Project that allows you create your own game by using Lua API!!, build game without rebuild source code or install alot stuff!

A heavily based on FNF Psych Engine!!

# Note For Something:
Since build game with this engine without rebuild source can maybe limited some API you may need but the code without coding yet!

For build source note: After doing `a hardly compile`, you will may notice that the script will load longer than when execute the application by pressing them!, consider prefer `lime build windows` as for `lime test windows` :>
